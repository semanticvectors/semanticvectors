 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is
the sea of Tiberias.


 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were diseased.


 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
disciples.


 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.


 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these
may eat?


 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would
do.


 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.


 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto
him,


 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small
fishes: but what are they among so many?


 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down.  Now there was much grass
in the place.  So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.


 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set
down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.


 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.


 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and
above unto them that had eaten.


 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.


 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain
himself alone.


 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the
sea,


 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.


 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.


 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and
they were afraid.


 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.


 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they went.


 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his
disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;


 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the
place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)


 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither
his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking
for Jesus.


 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?


 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of
the loaves, and were filled.


 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
you: for him hath God the Father sealed.


 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work
the works of God?


 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that
ye believe on him whom he hath sent.


 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
we may see, and believe thee?  what dost thou work?


 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He
gave them bread from heaven to eat.


 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven.


 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
giveth life unto the world.


 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.


 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst.


 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.


 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.


 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.


 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
again at the last day.


 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I
will raise him up at the last day.


 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
which came down from heaven.


 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
father and mother we know?  how is it then that he saith, I came down
from heaven?


 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
yourselves.


 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
him: and I will raise him up at the last day.


 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
God.  Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the
Father, cometh unto me.


 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,
he hath seen the Father.


 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life.


 I am that bread of life.


 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.


 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
eat thereof, and not die.


 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will
give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.


 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
man give us his flesh to eat?


 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye
have no life in you.


 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;
and I will raise him up at the last day.


 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.


 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
and I in him.


 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so
he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.


 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread
shall live for ever.


 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in
Capernaum.


 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,
This is an hard saying; who can hear it?


 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he
said unto them, Doth this offend you?


 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
before?


 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.


 But there are some of you that believe not.  For Jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray
him.


 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.


 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him.


 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?


 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?  thou
hast the words of eternal life.


 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son
of the living God.


 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of
you is a devil?


 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that
should betray him, being one of the twelve.
