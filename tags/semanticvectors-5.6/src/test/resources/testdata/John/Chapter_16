 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended.


 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.


 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.


 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of them.  And these things I said not
unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.


 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
me, Whither goest thou?


 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled
your heart.


 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.


 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment:


 Of sin, because they believe not on me;


 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no
more;


 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.


 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.


 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.


 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
shew it unto you.


 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that
he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.


 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.


 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and
again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the
Father?


 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while?
we cannot tell what he saith.


 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while,
and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see
me?


 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament,
but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy.


 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no
more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.


 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.


 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.  Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give
it you.


 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.


 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father.


 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you:


 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and
have believed that I came out from God.


 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,
I leave the world, and go to the Father.


 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb.


 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest
forth from God.


 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?


 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I
am not alone, because the Father is with me.


 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
peace.  In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer;
I have overcome the world.
